# Rock Paper Scissors (Lizard Spock)

Remake of the classic game. You can play with or without the Lizard Spock expansion.

I created this game because I could not find a simple and convenient enough game for this type.

Computer chooses its option randomly.

You can close the dialog with options (first screenshot) to give up and jump to the statistics (last screenshot).
